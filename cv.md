## Profile
**I have a Bachelor of Science from the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) with a minor in anthropology. I am currently a PhD candidate through UNR’s Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology (EECB) program studying how anthropogenic climate change factors such as extreme fire events and drought are altering single leaf pinyon pine community structure, terpene diversity, and how it is affecting indigenous groups who view the pinyon pine as a culturally significant species within the Great Basin.**
