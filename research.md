## Pinyon Pine–Juniper Community Dynamics
My research focuses on how anthropogenic climate change affects the community
structure of pinyon pine–juniper woodlands in the Great Basin and what that
means for food sovereignty, Indigenous communities, and ecosystem resilience.

- Community structure of arthropods associated with _Pinus monophylla_
- Effects of changing temperature and precipitation patterns on tree health
- Interactions between people, pinyon pines, and culturally important foods

## Chemical Ecology & Terpenes
I work with the Hitchcock Center for Chemical Ecology to analyze terpene
profiles in pinyon pine needles and relate these to herbivory and fire history.

(More details, figures, and links coming soon.)
