# Pinyon Pine–Juniper Community Dynamics

## Overview
Anthropogenic climate change is severally impacting the community structure of Pinus
monophyla (single leaf pinyon pine). Single leaf pinyon pine is adapted to use little water to
survive. However, pinyon pine trees are unable to survive the increasing drought conditions, and
this is resulting in desiccated pinyon pine and juniper communities. The increase in desiccated
vegetation has led to a greater incidence of fires. Wildfires in the pinyon-juniper community in
the Great Basin have burned for longer periods of time and have been hotter due to drought
conditions. The aftermath of these intense fires is an alteration to the ecosystem with invasive
species such as cheat grass invading burned areas (Weltz et al. 20141). The diversity of this
ecosystem was historically maintained by regular disturbance events such as fire within pinyon
pine and associated forests (Peterson 19982) (Kitchen 20123). However, with climate change
altering the delicate balance of this community, factors such as intense fire events and drought
are altering the community structure involving pinyon pines, the herbivorous arthropods that
utilize pine as a food resource, and vertebrates, such as the pinyon pine jay, that feed on the
herbivorous arthropods.

## Research Question
Is anthropogenic climate change factors such as  fire events and drought associated with lower arthropod diversity in pinyon-juniper communities?


## Methods
The object of this study is to determine the impact anthropogenic climate change factors
such as extreme fire events and drought have on the growth, cone production, herbivory by
lepidopteran caterpillars, density of associated shrubs and junipers, and terpene production by
pinyon pines. This multi-year field research involves the selection of nine locations that are
either unburned or burned on a continuous time scale from the year 2000 to 2019 across the
Great Basin of Nevada. Each location consists of three sampling plots per site with a twenty-
five-meter diameter. Within these plots, I look at the overall health of the pinyon pine grove and
its surroundings. I then take drone images between ten and fifty meters sequentially to examine
and record plant coverage of the plot. Next, I get a cone count on the pinyon pines within the plot
to record the reproductive health of the pines. The cone count is accomplished by visually
counting the number of cones either by eye or with binoculars. Then I take the diameter at breast
height and the height of all the pinyon pines within the plot. After this, I beat-sheet each non-
herbaceous plant in the plot to capture any caterpillars present. Lastly, I take plant samples, one
from the focal tree and one from another pinyon pine within the plot as well as from any plants
that had a caterpillars present on them, for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
