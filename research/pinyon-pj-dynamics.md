# Pinyon Pine–Juniper Community Dynamics

## Overview
This project investigates how anthropogenic climate change and disturbance shape
arthropod communities and tree health in pinyon pine–juniper woodlands of the Great Basin.

## Research Questions
- How do temperature and precipitation variability affect arthropod community structure?
- How does disturbance (fire history, drought) interact with tree health and herbivory?
- What are the implications for food sovereignty and culturally important species?

## Methods
- Repeated arthropod sampling on focal _Pinus monophylla_ trees  
- Tree health metrics (canopy condition, herbivory intensity)  
- Drone imagery for plot context  
- Environmental gradients (elevation, climate, disturbance history)

## Status
Ongoing (2022–present)

## Broader Impacts
This work informs understanding of ecosystem resilience and supports conversations
around Indigenous food sovereignty and land stewardship in the Great Basin.
