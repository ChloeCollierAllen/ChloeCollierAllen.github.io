# Pinyon Pine Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Profile

## Overview
The growing incidence and intensity of fires in the western United States is having drastic effects on ecosystems in the region as well as human communities. Fire is an important part of the landscape, but the recent trend towards higher intensity fires is leading to rapid alterations of biotic ecosystems and human activities within those ecosystems. Pinyon-juniper communities are abundant throughout the Great Basin and are affected by the increasing intensity of fires. The increase in the invasive species, Bromus tectorum (cheat grass) contributes to the increased acreage and intensity of these fires. Little is known about overall changes in phytochemical diversity, which is the richness and relative abundance of specialized metabolites in leaves, after fire. However, terpene levels in surviving pinyon pine needles can change significantly after very intense fires due to increased temperatures. Pinyon tissue terpene complexity and concentration could control insect herbivore populations and result in measurable declines in caterpillar-parasitoid interactions and diversity observed in Great Basin pinyon pines. Partly in response to fires, there have been concerted initiatives to remove pinyon pine and juniper species to reduce fuel load. In addition to potentially contributing to declines in insects associated with pinyons, removing these key species has contributed to an increase in soil erosion, since pine root systems keep rocky hillslope soils intact. I plan to quantify the interactions between high intensity fires and arthropod populations by collecting arthropods and pinyon pine needles in plots across a historical burn gradient.

## Research Question
How does climate and disturbance (e.g., fire events and drought) alter volatile organic compounds within pinyon pine?
