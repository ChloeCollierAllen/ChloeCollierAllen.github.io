# Indigenous Sovereignty of Pinyon Pine

## Overview
Historically, indigenous groups such as the Wa She Shu (Washoe), Numu (Northern Paiute), and Newe (Shoshone) have been stewards to regions of the Great Basin they inhabited and have cultivated a strong connection to the land. One such culturally important species is the single leafed pinyon pine (Pinus monophyla) as it provided much needed sustenance during harsh winters. However, due to factors such as cultural assimilation, loss of land, declining resource availability, and anthropogenic climate change leading to lower masting events, several indigenous groups have been stunted or have completely lost their connection to this culturally important resource. This loss of stewardship has led to decline of biodiversity within the pinyon pine-juniper community. Such losses include herbivorous arthropods that utilize pinyon-juniper communities as a food resource. I plan to quantify the interactions between anthropogenic climate change factors, loss of indigenous stewardship, and herbivorous arthropod populations. 

## Research Question
How have indigenous groups of the Great Basin historically stewarded *Pinus monophyla*?
