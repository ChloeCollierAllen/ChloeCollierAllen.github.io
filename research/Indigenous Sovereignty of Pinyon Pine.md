# Indigenous Sovereignty of Pinyon Pine

## Overview
Historically, indigenous groups such as the Wa She Shu (Washoe), Numu (Northern Paiute), and Newe (Shoshone) have been stewards to regions of the Great Basin they inhabited and have cultivated a strong connection to the land. One such culturally important species is the single leafed pinyon pine (Pinus monophyla) as it provided much needed sustenance during harsh winters. However, due to factors such as cultural assimilation, loss of land, declining resource availability, and anthropogenic climate change leading to lower masting events, several indigenous groups have been stunted or have completely lost their connection to this culturally important resource. This loss of stewardship has led to decline of biodiversity within the pinyon pine-juniper community. Such losses include herbivorous arthropods that utilize pinyon-juniper communities as a food resource. I plan to quantify the interactions between anthropogenic climate change factors, loss of indigenous stewardship, and herbivorous arthropod populations. 

## Research Question
How have indigenous groups of the Great Basin historically stewarded *Pinus monophyla*? 

## Methods
Due to recent government cuts, this project is paused indefinitely.

## Broader Impacts

This research engages directly with anthropological questions surrounding human–environment relationships, Indigenous knowledge systems, and community resilience in the Great Basin. Pinyon pine ecosystems are not only ecologically important but also culturally significant to many Indigenous communities, for whom pinyon pine nuts represent a traditional food source tied to subsistence, identity, and intergenerational knowledge. By examining how climate change and disturbance alter pinyon pine reproductive dynamics and associated ecological communities, this work contributes to a broader understanding of how environmental change affects culturally embedded food systems.

Through collaboration with community and tribal partners, including engagement with the Bi-State Tribal Natural Resources Committee, this project emphasizes respectful, community-informed research practices and the co-production of knowledge. Findings from this work have the potential to support tribal land stewardship, inform culturally relevant conservation strategies, and contribute data that may be useful for food sovereignty initiatives and adaptive management planning. More broadly, this research highlights the importance of integrating ecological data with Indigenous perspectives to address environmental challenges in ways that acknowledge social, cultural, and historical contexts.
