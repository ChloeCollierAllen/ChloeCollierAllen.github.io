# About Me

Hello! 

I am a native Nevadan and grew up in Reno, where summers were spent at Lake Tahoe and winters in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. These landscapes shaped my love for the outdoors. When I am not working, I enjoy skiing and snowboarding, hiking, running, camping, and spending time with my husband and our dogs.
