# About Me

I’m a second-year medical student with interests in biomedical research,
ecology, and community-engaged science. My work includes quantitative
modeling, field-based ecological research in the Great Basin, and projects
focused on food sovereignty and human–environment interactions.

I regularly work with R, Git, and reproducible research workflows, with a
particular interest in Bayesian and hierarchical modeling.
