# About Me

I’m a fifth-year PhD canidate with interests in ecology, anthropology, and chemistry. 
My work includes quantitative modeling, field-based ecological research in the Great Basin, and projects
focused on food sovereignty and human–environment interactions.

I regularly work with R, Git, and reproducible research workflows, with a
particular interest in Bayesian and hierarchical modeling.
