    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a second-year medical student with interests in biomedical research,
      ecology, and community-engaged science. My work includes quantitative
      modeling, field-based ecological research in the Great Basin, and projects
      focused on food sovereignty and human–environment interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I regularly work with R, Git, and reproducible research workflows, with a
      particular interest in Bayesian and hierarchical modeling.
