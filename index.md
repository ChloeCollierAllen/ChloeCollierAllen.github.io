Welcome! My name is Chloe and I am a 5th year PhD candidate at the University of Nevada, Reno studying how anthropogenic climate change is impacting the community structure of _Pinus monophylla_ found within the Great Basin.

## About Me

My work explores how anthropogenic climate change affects the community structure of pinyon pine–juniper woodlands and what that means for food sovereignty, Indigenous communities, and ecosystem resilience.

Outside of field season, I’m usually:

- Digging into statistics and Bayesian models in R  
- Working within the Hitchcock Center for Chemical Ecology looking at terpenes within _Pinus monophylla_  
- Collaborating with Indigenous entities and federal agencies to help protect the culturally important _Pinus monophylla_ species  
- Drinking too much coffee and cuddling my dogs  


## Current Research

**Pinyon–Juniper Community Dynamics**  
I study how anthropogenic climate change such as drought and fire shape caterpillar communities, tree health, and terpene levels of _Pinus monophylla_ within the Great Basin.

**Food Sovereignty & Indigenous Partnerships**  
I collaborate with Indigenous entities to help preserve the culturally important pinyon pine stands and support Tribal food sovereignty initiatives.


## Selected Projects

- **ENSOC 2025 Presentation** – Interaction diversity in pinyon–juniper ecosystems.
